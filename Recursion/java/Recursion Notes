🔹 What is Recursion?
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller part of the problem, until it reaches a point where it stops calling — called the base case.

🧠 Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine you're standing in a line of people. Each person asks the person in front of them:
“Hey, how many people are in front of you?”
That person does the same, until the first person (front of the line) says:
“Zero.”

Then everyone adds 1 and passes it back:

Copy
Edit
0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ...
This is recursion.
